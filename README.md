## Microservice Repositories ##

### API Gateway

### Order Service
[Order Service](https://github.com/Dare-Share-Care/exam-orders)
handles creation and storage of orders made through the MTOGO platform.

### Auth Service

### Email Service
[Email Service](https://github.com/Dare-Share-Care/exam-emails)
handles email sending through event-driven messages sent from various microservices. Currently as we're in the development phase, each email is caught by Mailtrap, which is an external email-testing platform.

### Notification Service
[Notification Service](https://github.com/Dare-Share-Care/exam-notification)
We did not start development on the notification service - the idea was to send notifications to various clients and their corresponding users using web sockets.
